Welcome to the ManageInvite Getting Started guide! This page summarizes the main information to get started with the bot. For more details on each feature, refer to the rest of this documentation.


## 🚀 Invite ManageInvite

First of all, you need to invite ManageInvite and configure its permissions correctly. Click [here](https://manage-invite.xyz/add) to add the bot to your server!
**Note**: ManageInvite will not be able to track your invites without the administrator permissions, as it needs to fetch your server invites when someone joins your server.

## 💬 Configure join messages

Once the bot is added to your server, you will be able to manage your server settings on the web dashboard!
You can access it by clicking [here](https://dash.manage-invite.xyz).

To enable join messages, log in to the dashboard and open the server settings page of your dashboard.
