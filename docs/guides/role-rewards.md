## Add a role

You can add new role to your server using the `+addrank` command. For example, if I want my members to obtain the `Silver` role when they reach 5 invites, I can use `+addrank 5 Silver`.

## List the roles

You can then run the `+ranks` command to get the updated list of your roles.

## Remove a role

You can also delete a role using the `+removerank` command. For example, if I no longer want my members to obtain the `Silver` role when they reach 5 invites, I can use `+removerank Silver`.

## Advanced configuration

ManageInvite also allows you to go further in the configuration of role rewards.

If you want the members to keep only their highest roles, you can use the `+set-stacked-ranks` command:

If you want the members to keep their roles even if they loose invites, you can use the `+set-keep-ranks` command:
